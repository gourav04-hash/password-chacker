### Final Thoughts

- **Windows Users**: They can download and run the `.exe` file or use the provided `.bat` file without needing Python installed.
- **Linux/macOS Users**: They can download the Python script and run it with Python, or use the provided executable if they prefer not to install Python.
- **No Python Installed?** By providing **executables** for both platforms, you make it easy for non-technical users to run the app directly.

Once you've followed these steps and uploaded the code to GitHub, users will be able to download it and run it on their respective operating systems without needing Python (for executables). Just ensure you have a clear **README.md** with instructions for users based on their OS. 

Let me know if you need more help or clarification!
